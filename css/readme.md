# CSS
CSS provides a library which greatly simplify how we write css styles in a more 
flexible way by using the power of Go templates and css parsers.


## Install

go get -u github.com/influx6/gu/css

## Gratitude
Thanks to the awesome work of the [CSS tokenizer by the Gorilla team](https://github.com/gorilla/css)  
and [Aymerick's css parser](https://github.com/aymerick/douceur) who by God's grace 
made this library possible.

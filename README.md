# Gu
  A component rendering library for Go. It efficiently renders standard HTML both on 
  the frontend and backend.

## Install

```
go install github.com/gu-io/gu/...
```

## Goals
  - Dead Simple API.
  - Simplicity and Flexibility.
  - Able to render on both front and back end.
  - Quickly craft your UI without touching HTML
  - Share code between backend and frontend

## Advantages
  - Complex widget libraries can be built up and shared as Golang packages.
  - Widgets are hierarchical allowing further reuse.
  - Event handling is simple and strongly typed.
  - Compile time safety
  - Fast to develop on, thanks to auto-reload.

## Documentation
  
  **[Getting Started](./docs/Getting Started.md)**

  **[Limitations](./docs/Limitations.md)**

## Examples
Basic examples are within the [Examples](./examples/) directory. 

All examples have `index.html` files within them, these are the points through which 
they can be runned. Simply open up the corresponding `index.html` within the example directory 
to see the end result within your browser.


## Why Gu and What next for Gu.
Gu main purpose is to provide a very simple and elegant approach in rendering front 
end components and projects with Go. It's simplicity will be heavily guarded and
maintained. 

If more complex ideas arise, then those will be built ontop of Gu as seperate 
libraries to offer that niche. But Gu will remain as so, to allow 
anyone to graft and build on top as they see fit.

Only changes that will ever come to the library will be updates for performance, 
fixes or needed changes that simplify and provide better usage for the developer.


## Contributions
 Contributions will be received with much fan fare and gratitude.

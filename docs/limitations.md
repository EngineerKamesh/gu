Limitations
===========
Gu by its very design and architecture was constructed to be "Simple". It lacks the bells and whistles of similar frameworks and libraries.
It's geared to solve your rendering needs and due to this, certain limitations exists with it.

1.	Gu provides no react like flux structure.

2.	Gu only focuses on providing you sets of structures able to work on the client and server for HTML/HTML5 rendering.

3.	Gu component are simply Go types that implements Gu's set of interfaces and nothing else.

Once these limitations are not a problem, I believe using the library should help in achieving the end product and design you wish to build.

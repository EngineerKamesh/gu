Getting Started
===============
Gu is fundamentally a library built to provide a component rendering package which exposes the means to effectively and efficiently render HTML/HTML5 content as needed.

It provides different concepts and packages which help fulfill this in the most idiomatic form possible. It was built with the philosophy that simplicity is far better than complexity, and carries this principle in the way it's structures are built.

It offers a driver based system which allows the package to be used to render to different output system (e.g Browser , Headless Webkit system, ...etc). Though some of these features and drivers are still in works, but already provides a [GopherJS](https://github.com/gopherjs) driver that showcases the possibility of the provided system.


*Gu is in no way a Flux-like framework. It is just a library that simply provides a baseline to render the desire output and gives the freedom for the developer to determine how their application data flow should works.*

The Concepts
---------
In grasping the examples and approach Gu takes, there exists certain concepts which need be introduced and you can quickly run down through them, has each concept tries to be short but informative about how that part of the Gu library works.

- [Virtual DOM](./concepts/dom.md)

- [Notifications](./concepts/notifications.md)

- [Routing](./concepts/routing.md)

- [Components](./concepts/components.md)

- [Embeddable Resource](./concepts/embedded-resources.md)


The Examples
-------------
Included with the Gu package are examples which demonstrate different examples
of using Gu to create web applications. Each example attempts to present different
areas which are usually general tasks when creating a web application.

I hope they help in understanding and developing your own application.


Last Note
---------
Please feel free to issue PR's and issues on suggestions, questions, changes, bugs or improvements for the library. They all will be gladly accepted and welcomed. God bless.

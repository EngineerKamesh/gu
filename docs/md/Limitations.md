# Limitations
 Gu by its very design and architecture was constructed to be "Simple".
 It lacks the bells and whistles of frameworks today and its geared to solve your rendering needs and due to this,
 certain limitations exists with it.

 1. Gu provides no react like flux structure

 2. Gu provides only focuses on providing you sets of structures able to work on the client and server for rendering.

 3. Gu component are simply structures that implements its provided interfaces and nothing else.

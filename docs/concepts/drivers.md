Drivers
=======

Drivers are a system developed in the redesign of Gu to provide capability to render the result of a giving app to any supportable platform. Due to the rise in rendering targets such as Mobile and Desktop, we eagerly believe that GopherJS will not be the only means to deliver applications to users, hence there was a need to provide a means by which the same Gu applications can be rendered on such platforms with ease.

GopherJS does provide a convenient and powerful means to take Go Apps into the JS world, but we desired to allow flexibility in the way anyone can take the any app built on Gu, to easily be rendered and usable on different targets/systems and drivers met that need.

By easily abstracting out the rendering details for each platform and making the core Gu package concentrate on organization and structures, we easily allow flexibility for more larger systems which can easily embed any app built with Gu.

*We hope that developers will take this and push the boundaries further to allow easy deployment of Gu apps to other platforms e.g QT, Android, iOS,...etc*

Examples of Drivers:
--------------------

Below are the list of drivers being actively developed or are already usable. We hope this list can increase the more.

-	GopherJS Driver(https://github.com/gu-io/gopherjs/) (Stable)
-	QT Driver(https://github.com/gu-io/qt) (Experiemental)

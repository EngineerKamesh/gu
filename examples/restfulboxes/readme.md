# RestfulBoxes
RestfulBoxes provides an example of using Gu with a http backend to create components
which define their look by the data they receive. The example code is highly trivial but helps demonstrates the simplicity of the approach.


## Run
First of all pull in servex or any prefer http server lunch tool

```bash
go get -u github.com/influx6/clis/...
```

Then run servex or desired lunch tool with port `4040`

```bash
servex -addr :4040
```

# Examples
It's important to note that Gu does not provide a platform means to render through 
the OS but uses the same approach where it generates a structure which produces 
the HTML to be rendered on the backend and through specific structures automatically
handles rendering on the frontend in the browser. 

There are not binaries to run, but simple html files to open.

*Please all there is to running the examples is opening the `index.html` file in 
browser, more examples showcasing rendering from the server will be included later*

Two examples showcasing the possibility of using Gu for creating components 
and how they are used.

## [Hello](./hello/)
This example showcases how the organization structures of `Gu`, also known as resources
help define a page and its content.

## [Subscribe](./subscribe)
This example showcases how components can be built with self descriptive markups
and layered within `Gu` resources to build a app with it's corresponding pages.

# Hello example

Because GU compiles to a SPA web app, you can just run the index.html in a browser immediatly.

````
file:///Users/apple/workspace/go/src/github.com/gu-io/gu/examples/hello/index.html
````


To run a Build just do:

````
gopherjs build -o hello.go hello.js
````

To run Continuous Build do:

````
http://localhost:8080/github.com/gu-io/gu/examples/hello/
````
